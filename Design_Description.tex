\subsubsection*{ ---Description}
The goal of the impedance controller was to force the response of a relatively simple reference system onto a very different, more complex real system. The real system was a linear actuator connected to a motor through a belt drive and powered by the myRIO microcomputer's control signal amplified through a current amplifier. 

The reference system simulated by the impedance controller was an ideal mass, spring, damper system all in parallel with a force input. The continuous time transfer function was found using normal tree state equation formulation. The continuous time transfer function was discretized into a single biquad using Tustin's approximation. This approximation was calculated by hand in order to find the symbolic relationships between the coefficients of the transfer function and the parameters set by the user. This was crucial to enable the user to adjust the mass, stiffness and damping of the system while the program ran instead of closing out and rerunning a MATLAB script to recalculate the biquad structure. The results of the hand calculation were verified using MATLAB before testing began.
