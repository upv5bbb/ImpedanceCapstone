\subsection*{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{---Problem Definition} \par
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the viability of a variable impedance controller with the use of a one-dimensional prototype. Variable impedance control utilizes user input in order to achieve a desired state of mobility. The system senses a force and responds by changing its impedance to match the desired input parameters of the user. The user will be able to control the virtual weight, damping, and spring force. These virtual parameters will dictate how the system performs while being used. \par
There are many applications for this research and while only a simple prototype, the implications are far-reaching. With variable impedance control, a heavy object can feel lighter and be easier to maneuver. Lighter objects that don't provide enough feedback for a human can have their apparent weight increased. When human control and reasoning is desired over robot logic, variable impedance control can make a difference. This report details the design and construction of a one-dimensional cart prototype that successfully demonstrates the capability of a variable impedance controller.\par
