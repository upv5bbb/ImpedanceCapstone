\subsection*{Impact on the Environment}
The prototype is composed primarily of relatively environmentally friendly materials. The track and mounting plates are all aluminum and the mounting hardware is all steel. The rest of the prototype is made from PLA which is compostable. At the end of the prototype's service life, it can be easily separated into the different component materials for responsible disposal. The technology that makes the prototype may also have an impact on the environment. If impedance control is used for mobile, human operated industrial robots, the machine would require a large battery to power the motors necessary. Such large batteries are not easily recycled and can be harmful to the environment when disposed. Otherwise, the technology can benefit the environment if implemented to refine docking procedures to refuel ships and minimize the chance of spillage.
