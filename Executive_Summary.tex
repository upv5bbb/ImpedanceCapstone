\subsection*{Executive Summary}

This capstone project investigates the design and implementation of a variable impedance controller. Altering an object's apparent mass, damping, and spring force using a controller and motor is the purpose of this report. The basis for the control scheme is a set of functional specifications for the system to achieve. The system, in this case, is a one-dimensional prototype consisting of a cart on a motor-driven V-belt track. The design of the controller was performed in MATLAB and then run in Simulink to determine the necessary motor and amplifier specifications. Once verified in the simulations, the controller was implemented using a National Instruments myRIO microcomputer that compares the cart velocity with a reference velocity that is calculated from the desired mass, spring, and damping.
