\subsection*{Executive Summary}

This capstone project investigates the design and implementation of a variable-impedance controller. The basis for the control scheme is a set of functional specifications for the system to achieve. These requirements dictate the controller design as well as the motor and amplifier used. The controller is designed to compare the velocity of the actual system with a reference velocity that is calculated from the desired mass, spring, and damping.  The system, in this case, is a one-dimensional prototype consisting of a cart on a motor-driven V-belt track.
