\subsection*{Codes and Standards{{\color{red}\ *}}}
In the design and assembly of the prototype, several different components were soldered together. To avoid damage to the components and ensure proper functionality, the soldering had to be done according to certain standards. For example, the encoder has four leads bundled into one cable. Each lead was separately soldered to the appropriate pin on the DIN including shrink wrapping each individual wire as well as the complete bundle. The shrink wrapping is important to ensure no wires are crossed which could result in damage to one or more components.
