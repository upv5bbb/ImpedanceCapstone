\subsubsection*{ --- Final Product Configuration}
The final prototype demonstrates the viability of a variable impedance controller for potential use in industrial or commercial practices (manufacturing, warehouse storage, injury rehabilitation). The one-dimensional setup proves the computational, mechanical, and electrical integration necessary to utilize such a controller. The prototype results show that the system is able to respond in a predictable manner, which is vital considering the human interaction inherent in variable impedance control. In the future, the modeling and design principles that went into the prototype are expandable to multiple axes. Some hardware changes would be necessary, but the computations the controller uses would stay consistent. This project showcases how a variable impedance controller may enhance human-machine interaction in the future.
