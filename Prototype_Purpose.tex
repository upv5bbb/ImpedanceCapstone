\subsubsection*{ --- Purpose}
The purpose of the prototype was to verify that the controller design would accomplish the goals set at the inception of the project. Constructing the prototype and running several tests ranging from simulated forces (voltage values set in the program in place of load cell voltage readings) to constant force inputs to random force inputs. Data was collected for the force input and velocity output and compared to Simulink results for the same system. Comparing the results and determining the true overshoot and settling times of the response allows quantification of the effectiveness of the controller and modeling.
